# **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.**

This game is an extension of the current, less complex game, rock, paper, scissors. This application will allow users to play against a truly random opponent in the computer, as people who are aware or each others personality, tend to be able to gain an advantage by predicting how their opponent might guess.

This game is targetted at adults and children; in addition to, fans of the Big Bang Theory. Players will be able to learn the rules of the game and have bundles of fun with this new update to the common decision making game of rock, paper, scissors.
